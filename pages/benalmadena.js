      <p>The Nearest Village is Benalmadena pueblo, within walking distance of the house where you can chose between 20 great restaurants, tapas bars and cafes, shop for groceries and souvenirs and wander the streets appreciating the decoration and arquitecture of a village which has won awards for its beauty. There are wine bars, delis, cake and pastry cafes, ice cream and terrace bars to while away your evenings enjoying the views and people watching.</p>

      The Beaches in the vicinity are lovely and apart from July and august when the weekends are very busy with locals, are quite unpacked. There are great beach bars for lunch. Try Parador 2, just next to the Hotel Playabonita for a fabulous paella, bbq sardinas and fresh seafood.
